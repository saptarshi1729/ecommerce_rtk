# About the Project

Here we explored how to use Redux Toolkit to manage state throughout the entire application in such a way that it can be accessed by any component without following the hierarchy between the components. We built a simple E-Commerce application using React and Redux where we have displayed a list of products with an "Add to Cart" button for each product, display the items added to the cart, and allow users to remove items from the cart. All this information is going to be globally available throughout the application using Redux Toolkit.
